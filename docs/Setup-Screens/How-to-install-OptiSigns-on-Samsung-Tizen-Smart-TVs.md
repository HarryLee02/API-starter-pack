<p>While OptiSigns app is available on Samsung Tizen app store, we still recommend to use a dedicated player like <a href="https://links.optisigns.com/szzk">OptiSigns Android Player</a> due to following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Samsung Tizen does not allow apps to autostart, include Digital Signage app like OptiSigns, so not really suitable for digital signage unless your team can turn on/off TV every day as part of their schedule</li>
<li>Low local storage, usually only a few hundreds MBs available. It's good for streaming Youtube, Netflix, but for Digital Signage you want your content to be downloaded and cached locally to ensure playback even when there’s network interruption and save bandwidths.</li>
<li>OptiSigns app are not available on some Samsung TV models and regions</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, if you want to play small simple playlist with couple of images, videos, weather apps, and don't mind manually launching the app when Samsung TV powered on, you can continue to install OptiSigns app on Samsung TV.</p>
