<p>Now you can assign this MS Teams Meeting app to your screens, or put it on a schedule so the screens will join automatically when the meeting start.</p>
<p>The screens will join the meeting as Guests with names are the name of the screens.</p>
<p>This can also be done with Teams Town hall. To enable Town hall, simply hit <strong>Share Event</strong>, then copy the <strong>Join </strong><strong>link </strong>URL and paste this into OptiSigns.</p>

<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<p>Have the host start the meeting a few mins before screens are joining automatically.<br>It will take a device 10-15s to join the meeting, so it's not a good idea to put the Teams Meeting in a playlist. It's better to use it as single asset to take up full screen or be part of a <a href="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026559573" target="_self">SplitScreen zone</a>.</p>
