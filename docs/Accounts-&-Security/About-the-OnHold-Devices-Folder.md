<p>When poking around the Screens tab in OptiSigns, you may have noticed the <strong>OnHold Devices</strong> folder.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487094095251" alt="optisigns web portal onhold devices folder" width="624" height="109"></p>
<p>This useful folder allows you to place screens to the side, where they will no longer count toward your license count.</p>
<p>To do this, click the <strong>Three Dots </strong>icon, then hit the <strong>“Move to OnHold Devices” </strong>option.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>This feature can be used by any OptiSigns user, from <strong>Free Plan </strong>and above.</p>

<h2 id="h_01JKXW4W9M49VTW672AFB0A3SG">What Happens when a Screen is Placed in the OnHold Folder</h2>
<p>To show the value of the OnHold Folder, a demonstration is in order. The easiest way to see how it works is to go to the <strong>Subscription Plan </strong>screen, through your account options:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487052567187" alt="subscription plan web portal" width="167" height="272"></p>
<p>When here, you’ll see a screen similar to this:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487094100371" alt="screens vs screen licenses" width="624" height="233"></p>
<p>This means that this account has 10 screen licenses, and is currently using a single screen.</p>
<p>Now, we’ll navigate back to the screen tab. Click any screen and hit the <strong>“Move to OnHold Folder” </strong>option. You’ll be given this prompt:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487094101395" alt="onhold devices confirmation screen" width="624" height="292"></p>
<p>Crucially, <strong><em>any content displaying on this screen will cease</em></strong>. For all intents and purposes, hitting <strong>Move </strong>here will deactivate this screen completely. Pushing content to this screen will show this:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487052574483" alt="onhold optisigns player" width="541" height="380"></p>
<p>If you are alright with the above, hitting <strong>Move </strong>will place it in the Folder. It will disappear from the Screens tab, and you’ll see the number next to the OnHold Devices folder go up, signifying that the screen is in this folder now.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487052580499" alt="onhold folder number" width="624" height="72"></p>
<p>Clicking the OnHold Devices folder will let you see the screen again.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487094106515" alt="screens present in onhold folder" width="624" height="85"></p>
<p>Hitting <strong>Edit</strong> on any screen in the OnHold Devices folder will display a much shorter list of options until it is removed from the folder.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487094109331" alt="onhold folder edit screen" width="624" height="361"></p>
<p>Now, to see the effects of moving a screen to the OnHold folder, navigate back to the <strong>Subscription Plan </strong>screen. Your active screen count will have decreased by one:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487052589587" alt="screens vs screen licenses after onhold folder" width="624" height="239"></p>
<p>Note that this <strong><em>does not affect total license count</em></strong><em>. </em>All this does is free up a license for a different screen while not deleting your screen’s settings. This lets your account have more screens registered than licenses, in case you need to swap them around.</p>

<h2 id="h_01JKXW4W9MKHYMBBBAT5SMFS09">Removing a Screen From the OnHold Devices Folder</h2>
<p>Before you can remove a screen from the OnHold Devices folder, you’ll need a free license space. So, if you’re at your screen limit, either move a different screen into the OnHold Devices folder, or delete a screen before starting.</p>
<p>The actual process of removing a screen from the folder is straightforward. First, navigate to the OnHold Devices folder:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487052592659" alt="onhold devices folder screen" width="624" height="84"></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Three Dots</strong> icon, then click <strong>Move</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487052599059" alt="move out of the onhold folder options" width="216" height="149"></p>
<p>A screen will show up displaying all your created Screen folders. By default, hitting <strong>Move </strong>without clicking one of these folders will move it to the Screens tab homepage. Either select a folder to use, or simply hit Move:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487052600851" alt="move screen out of onhold folder" width="405" height="100"></p>
<p>Now, you should see a notification letting you know the move was successful, and the screen should no longer be present in your OnHold Devices folder:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487052602899" alt="move successful notification" width="624" height="97"></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>If you do not have any free licenses, this notification will not appear, and you will not be able to remove your screen from the folder until you free up a license or purchase more.</p>
<p>Your screen will be placed wherever you moved it, and it can now be assigned content again.</p>
