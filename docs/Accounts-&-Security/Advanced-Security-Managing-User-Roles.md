<p>With OptiSigns, it's possible to control User access by granting various roles. Roles can be assigned, and custom roles created to provide more granular control of user security. For example, you may want someone to contribute content, but not add new screens.</p>

<h2 id="h_01JJ79CAEW1BB5K1VPQ82SVDCM">Accessing User Management</h2>
<p>User roles can be managed by the <strong>Account Owner</strong>, or Super Admin. They can be accessed through the <strong>Account Members </strong>tab under your User Profile:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38720525740691" alt="mceclip0.jpg"></p>
<p>You'll see a list of Users and Teams. By default, it will only be the Owner (Super Admin) in the Default Team.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38720509819027" alt="mceclip1.jpg"></p>
<p>From here, you are able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Add - </strong>Adds users directly.</li>
<li>
<strong>Invite </strong>- Sends invite to users. Most helpful if your company uses SSO.</li>
<li>
<strong>Manage Roles </strong>- Allows creation of custom roles and allows management of created roles</li>
<li>
<strong>Manage Members </strong>- Controls the members within this Team.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more on Teams, see our article on <strong><a href="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034883113-Working-with-Teams-and-Security-Levels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Working with Teams and Security Levels</a>. </strong>For now, we will continue our discussion of User Roles.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="Default"></a></p>
<h2 id="h_01JJ77K1YG3R1SWC2ARQV82QTT">Default User Roles</h2>
<p>By default, there are 6 roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Owner (Super Admin) - </strong>Have full access to all teams. Can create teams and access billing. Capable of inviting users to teams, managing all screens, and resetting passwords across multiple teams.</li>
<li>
<strong>Admin </strong><strong>- </strong>Has full access to an individual team. Can invite users to the team, manage the number of screens available per team, and reset passwords for other users.</li>
<li>
<strong>User </strong>- Can create, edit, and delete all content within the folders they have access to. Can add or remove screens.</li>
<li>
<strong>Content Proposal - </strong>Can create new files and assets, and propose changes to playlists. Cannot add or remove screens.</li>
<li>
<strong>Content Approval - </strong>Similar to User, but can review and approve content change proposals. Can add or remove screens.</li>
<li>
<strong>Read Only - </strong>Can only view folders they have access to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's what each will look like in a single team:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38720525745043" alt="mceclip5.jpg"></p>
<p>It's possible to create custom roles, as well.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="Creating"></a></p>
<h2 id="h_01JJ7CVD1XZMF3KZMVK6MJ9WS7">Creating New User Roles</h2>
<p>To create a custom role, hit the <strong>Manage Roles </strong>button:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38720784822035" alt="mceclip7.jpg"></p>
<p>When first getting started, you will have no custom roles created. To make one, hit <strong>New Role</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38720784824083" alt="mceclip8.jpg"></p>
<p>You'll see this somewhat intimidating screen:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38720784826003" alt="mceclip9.jpg"></p>
<p>The <strong>Name </strong>refers to the name of the role (i.e. Admin, User, etc.). The other options control what sorts of access the Role has.</p>
<p>In this example, we'll be creating a custom role called Designer. We want the Designer to be able to create and upload content, but have no access to screens, playlists or schedules. This role would be one we'd consider for an outside contractor or someone we view as a slight security risk.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38720784827923" alt="mceclip12.jpg"></p>
<p>Once you've given the appropriate permissions to the role and named it, hit <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p>You'll now see a list of Managed Roles. In this example, we've only created one, but if you create more they will all appear here.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38720784829715" alt="mceclip13.jpg"></p>
<p>Role permissions can be easily checked by hitting the small carrot next to the role name:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38720784834067" alt="mceclip14.jpg"></p>
<p>Now, any user given this role will have these permissions.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="AddingorInviting"></a></p>
<h2 id="h_01JJ79CAEWSYQ2FD4ZHYDR7V8X">Adding or Inviting Users</h2>
<p>Now that you've created the custom roles you'll want for your team, you'll need to actually give them access to the OptiSigns platform in their assigned role. This can be done in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Adding</strong> them directly to OptiSigns</li>
<li>
<strong>Inviting </strong>them via email</li>
</ol>
<p>These users can be set up to be either individuals, or a Job Title within your company.</p>
<p>To Add a user directly, hit the <strong>Add </strong>button.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38720525755667" alt="mceclip6.jpg"></p>
<p>You'll see this screen. Here, you can input user information, including First Name, Last Name, Email, and Role. You can automatically generate a password, then allow the user to change it once they log in.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38720768955411" alt="mceclip15.jpg"></p>
<p>The Roles can be selected from a drop-down. The options include the 6 default roles and any custom roles you've made.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38720784838419" alt="mceclip16.jpg"></p>
<p>Once the information has been put in successfully, you'll see a confirmation:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38720784847379" alt="mceclip17.jpg"></p>
<p>These login credentials can be sent directly to an email address.</p>
<p>Inviting users is a very similar process. To begin, hit the <strong>Invite </strong>button.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38720784851347" alt="mceclip19.jpg"></p>
<p>The difference here is that account information will be need to be set up by the end user.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38720768965523" alt="mceclip18.jpg"></p>
<p>This is most useful for SSO setups.</p>
<p>If you're wanting to add users via SAML SSO, please see the <a href="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/sections/26319189062803-SSO-SAML" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>SSO &amp; SAML section</strong></a> of our Knowledge Base.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="Managing"></a></p>
<h2 id="h_01JJ7CVD1XB2BDWB0DM13XEY9A">Managing Users</h2>
<p>The Manage Members tab allows you to quickly reassign user roles and teams across your entire account.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38720768970771" alt="mceclip20.jpg"></p>
<p>From here, you can add or remove users from teams, and quickly change their roles. By default, it displays only users who have an account but are not in the current team.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38720784856339" alt="mceclip21.jpg"></p>
<p>As you can see, we have the option to add our additional account to this team, and define its role. New users can be Added or Invited from here, as well.</p>
<p>If you want to manage all accounts at once, hit <strong>Show All Members</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38720768973843" alt="mceclip23.jpg"></p>
<p>Now these members can be removed from this Team, and have their user permissions changed.</p>
