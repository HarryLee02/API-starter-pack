We recommend having this on, so the account owner and admin account will be able to manage the account without interruption, e.g. forgetting the password, or an issue with identifying the provider. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HQ071K11FD3T93ZKW59HSXDB\"><strong>There are 2 Strategies for using SAML:</strong></h4>\n<p><strong>1) As an Authentication &amp; Authorization Service </strong>to enforce identity verification like above, but also enforce user, team, and role mapping in OptiSigns, With this approach you will map all users to groups in your IDP, and map the IDP groups to OptiSigns teams/roles. When there's a change in IDP like a user is added or moved group, it will automatically reflect in OptiSigns. <strong>We recommend this approach</strong>.</p>\n<p>To implement this, check \"Enable User Override\", with this enabled, every time a user logs in using SAML, OptiSigns will check to see if their group assignment has changed, and enforce that accordingly, also if their name has changed, updated, it will also update OptiSigns.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/4407135779603\" alt=\"mceclip1.png\" width=\"377\" height=\"224\"></p>\n<p>Map all your appropriate groups to roles &amp; team in OptiSigns.</p>\n<p>For example we have 3 groups:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marketing West Coast - users responsible for managing screens, content for West region</li>\n<li>Marketing East Coast - user responsible for manage screens, content for East region</li>\n<li>IT Support - Admin that can support both region and do other admin tasks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The mapping should be like below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/4407128634643\" alt=\"mceclip3.png\"></p>\n<p>With this set up, if a user belong to Marketing West Coast, later moved to Marketing East Coast, you just need to update your IDP move him/her from Marketing West Coast to Marketing East Coast, next time the user log in, he/she now belong to and can only see \"Marketing West Coast\" team content in OptiSigns.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>2) As Authentication Service Only</strong> to enforce your MFA, Password policy, and remove user will no longer have access to OptiSigns. You will still can assigns, manage these users to Teams, Roles in OptiSigns. This approach is quick to set up and flexible as you can quickly move users around in OptiSigns, but when users moved around in your IDP, you will have to remember to move them around in OptiSigns as well, if that's a requirement.</p>\n<p>To implement this, uncheck \"Enable User Override\"</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/4407136124435\" alt=\"mceclip4.png\" width=\"338\" height=\"204\"></p>\n<p>This way, in the example above. When a user move from Marketing West Coast to Marketing East Coast.</p>\n<p>You will need to go to OptiSigns and move the user's team assignment, if that's required.</p>\n<p>Also if when the user update, change their name, you will have to update OptiSigns as well to keep it in sync.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HQ071K11M4WVEWY4KHQ29JFK\"><strong>Enable User Creation:</strong></h4>\n<p>We recommend to keep this option checked. When this option is enabled, if users authenticated and SAML setting map the user to a team, role that can use OptiSigns, the user will be created automatically.</p>\n<p>If disabled, you will have to create each user first in OptiSigns before they can log in with SAML SSO.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/4407136156819\" alt=\"mceclip5.png\" width=\"389\" height=\"247\"></p>\n<p>In the example above, if there are 20 users belong to Marketing West Coast group in your IDP, and Marketing West Coast is mapped to the Marketing West Coast team in OptiSigns.</p>\n<p>If user A belong to Marketing West Coast group logs in, he/she will be created in OptiSigns and can start working right away to with West Coast Team screens and content.</p>\n<p>The other 19 users are not created in OptiSigns until they attempt to log in.</p>\n<p>You can also map the \"Unmapped users/groups\" to \"No Team (Disable)\", this way if a user belong to some other group in your IDP like say \"Sales West Coast\" try to log in, they will get an error and the user is not created in OptiSigns.</p>\n<p>This way you can keep the system clean and only necessary users that using the app are replicated.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/4407136240659\" alt=\"mceclip6.png\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you have any questions or need help with SAML integration please feel free to reach out to us at <a href=\"mailto:support@optisigns.com\">support@optisigns.com</a></p>\n<p> </p>"}, {"id": 4404590815635, "url": "https://optisignshelp.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/4404590815635.json", "html_url": "https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404590815635-How-to-set-up-SAML-2-0-with-OptiSigns-and-Okta", "author_id": 373132830174, "comments_disabled": true, "draft": false, "promoted": false, "position": 0, "vote_sum": -2, "vote_count": 4, "section_id": 26319189062803, "created_at": "2021-08-01T12:44:32Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-28T18:08:26Z", "name": "How to set up SAML 2.0  with OptiSigns and Okta", "title": "How to set up SAML 2.0  with OptiSigns and Okta", "source_locale": "en-us", "locale": "en-us", "outdated": false, "outdated_locales": [], "edited_at": "2025-02-28T18:08:26Z", "user_segment_id": null, "permission_group_id": 787493, "content_tag_ids": [], "label_names": [], "body": "<p>With Pro Plus and Enterprise plans, you can configure SAML 2.0 with OptiSigns via Okta.</p>\n<p>Assuming you already using Okta for identity management.

Can create teams and access billing. Capable of inviting users to teams, managing all screens, and resetting passwords across multiple teams.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Admin </strong><strong>- </strong>Has full access to an individual team. Can invite users to the team, manage the number of screens available per team, and reset passwords for other users.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>User </strong>- Can create, edit, and delete all content within the folders they have access to. Can add or remove screens.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Content Proposal - </strong>Can create new files and assets, and propose changes to playlists. Cannot add or remove screens.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Content Approval - </strong>Similar to User, but can review and approve content change proposals. Can add or remove screens.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Read Only - </strong>Can only view folders they have access to.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here's what each will look like in a single team:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38720525745043\" alt=\"mceclip5.jpg\"></p>\n<p>It's possible to create custom roles, as well.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a name=\"Creating\"></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JJ7CVD1XZMF3KZMVK6MJ9WS7\">Creating New User Roles</h2>\n<p>To create a custom role, hit the <strong>Manage Roles </strong>button:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38720784822035\" alt=\"mceclip7.jpg\"></p>\n<p>When first getting started, you will have no custom roles created.

The other options control what sorts of access the Role has.</p>\n<p>In this example, we'll be creating a custom role called Designer. We want the Designer to be able to create and upload content, but have no access to screens, playlists or schedules.

The easiest way to see how it works is to go to the <strong>Subscription Plan </strong>screen, through your account options:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487052567187\" alt=\"subscription plan web portal\" width=\"167\" height=\"272\"></p>\n<p>When here, you’ll see a screen similar to this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487094100371\" alt=\"screens vs screen licenses\" width=\"624\" height=\"233\"></p>\n<p>This means that this account has 10 screen licenses, and is currently using a single screen.</p>\n<p>Now, we’ll navigate back to the screen tab. Click any screen and hit the <strong>“Move to OnHold Folder” </strong>option. You’ll be given this prompt:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487094101395\" alt=\"onhold devices confirmation screen\" width=\"624\" height=\"292\"></p>\n<p>Crucially, <strong><em>any content displaying on this screen will cease</em></strong>. For all intents and purposes, hitting <strong>Move </strong>here will deactivate this screen completely. Pushing content to this screen will show this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487052574483\" alt=\"onhold optisigns player\" width=\"541\" height=\"380\"></p>\n<p>If you are alright with the above, hitting <strong>Move </strong>will place it in the Folder. It will disappear from the Screens tab, and you’ll see the number next to the OnHold Devices folder go up, signifying that the screen is in this folder now.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487052580499\" alt=\"onhold folder number\" width=\"624\" height=\"72\"></p>\n<p>Clicking the OnHold Devices folder will let you see the screen again.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487094106515\" alt=\"screens present in onhold folder\" width=\"624\" height=\"85\"></p>\n<p>Hitting <strong>Edit</strong> on any screen in the OnHold Devices folder will display a much shorter list of options until it is removed from the folder.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487094109331\" alt=\"onhold folder edit screen\" width=\"624\" height=\"361\"></p>\n<p>Now, to see the effects of moving a screen to the OnHold folder, navigate back to the <strong>Subscription Plan </strong>screen.

So, if you’re at your screen limit, either move a different screen into the OnHold Devices folder, or delete a screen before starting.</p>\n<p>The actual process of removing a screen from the folder is straightforward. First, navigate to the OnHold Devices folder:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487052592659\" alt=\"onhold devices folder screen\" width=\"624\" height=\"84\"></p>\n<p>Click the <strong>Three Dots</strong> icon, then click <strong>Move</strong>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487052599059\" alt=\"move out of the onhold folder options\" width=\"216\" height=\"149\"></p>\n<p>A screen will show up displaying all your created Screen folders. By default, hitting <strong>Move </strong>without clicking one of these folders will move it to the Screens tab homepage. Either select a folder to use, or simply hit Move:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487052600851\" alt=\"move screen out of onhold folder\" width=\"405\" height=\"100\"></p>\n<p>Now, you should see a notification letting you know the move was successful, and the screen should no longer be present in your OnHold Devices folder:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487052602899\" alt=\"move successful notification\" width=\"624\" height=\"97\"></p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>If you do not have any free licenses, this notification will not appear, and you will not be able to remove your screen from the folder until you free up a license or purchase more.</p>\n<p>Your screen will be placed wherever you moved it, and it can now be assigned content again.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a name=\"FAQs\"></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JKXW4W9MBH6YXXZYRSXQ1ZXM\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n<p>Here, we’ll address some common issues our users face when dealing with the OnHold folder.</p>\n<p><a name=\"Fix\"></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"01JKXWTW8YHPH4AK52AFEH9XZ5\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\">My screen is saying my device is OnHold, how do I fix this?</span></h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38487052574483\" width=\"541\" height=\"380\"></p>\n<p>If your screen says your device is OnHold, that means the device is in the OnHold folder.
