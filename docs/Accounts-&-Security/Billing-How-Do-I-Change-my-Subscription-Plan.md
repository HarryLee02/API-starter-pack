<p>It's extremely easy to change the details of your OptiSigns subscription. From the type of plan you're using, to the number of screens associated with the account, to the add-on licenses you've purchased, all of this can be managed on the Subscription Plan screen.</p>
<p>In addition, you can change payment terms from Monthly to Yearly and vice versa. Our billing system will prorate your charges as appropriate.</p>
