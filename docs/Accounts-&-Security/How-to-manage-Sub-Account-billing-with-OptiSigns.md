<p>OptiSigns supports managing billing for sub-accounts. With this feature, headquarters/corporate can manage the billing &amp; payment on behalf of the subsidiaries, like franchisees or different departments. For example, a branch manages the account and screens on its own, but corporates can set up the subaccount and add payment methods for local branches.<br><br><strong>Important Note</strong>: Sub-account is a separate account, so <strong>screens</strong>, <strong>contents</strong>, <strong>playlists,</strong> and <strong>schedules</strong> are segregated in the subaccount. The sub-account billing feature is only to support the main account to manage the billing and payment for the sub-account.</p>
<p>If you would like to manage the recourses in the "sub-account" instead, we suggest that you use the "<a href="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034883113" target="_self"><strong>Teams</strong></a>" feature so that you can reserve the screens per team, and then allocate the cost by the number of screens.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you are a very large franchise or, organizations that need over 50+ sub-accounts, please reach out to us we have a team billing feature that may be more suitable for you. </p>
