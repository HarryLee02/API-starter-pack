<p>With OptiSigns, you can set up Teams, invite other users / account members and set security levels.<br>Team(like workspace) is built for segregation, all the resources (Screens, Assets, Users etc) in a team are segregated from other teams. Account owner will have access to all the teams, if you need to act as a global administrator and have access to all the teams, you can use the Super Admin role for that purpose.</p>
