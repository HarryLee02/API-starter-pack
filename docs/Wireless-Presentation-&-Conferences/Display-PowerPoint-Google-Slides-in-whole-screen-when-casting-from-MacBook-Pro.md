<p>In this article, we will show you if you try to present your MacBook Pro to AeriCast Add-on app via OptiSigns app. There is an extra black space on your screen. It is because the MacBook Pro is 16:10 in resolution. Most TV screens are 16:9.</p>

<p>Here is the suggestion:</p>
<p>1. Upload the PowerPoint file to Microsoft 365 or Google Slides. Open the file in Microsoft365/Google Slides in the web browser. Go to <a href="https://present.aericast.com" target="_self">https://present.aericast.com</a> and present the specific browser "tab" of the M 365/Google Slides page, instead of the whole screen. Then resize the browser window to fit the presentation slide content, assuming it's 16:9 based. This will cast the presentation to the entire TV screen without additional blank spaces.</p>

<p>2. Change MacBook Pro's resolution to a 16:9 based resolution during the presentation, but this may require a 3rd party app to do so. =&gt; This is Apple's limitation.</p>
