<p>With OptiSigns Pro or Enterprise Plan, you can set up Approval Workflow so that you can have:</p>
<p>1) Contributors in your organization that can create, upload contents, make changes to Playlists</p>
<p>2) Then submit to Admin or Approver to review &amp; approve (email notification available)</p>
<p>3) Once approved, the changes will be applied to your screens immediately</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>To demonstrate an example,</strong> we will create 2 users:</p>
<ul>
<li>John the Proposer - who will add some content to a playlist and submit for approval</li>
<li>Jane the Approver - who will review the changes made by John and approve it</li>
</ul>

<p>First go to <a href="https://beta.optisigns.com/app/s/account-members" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Account Member page</a> and add John with Content Proposal role and Jane with Content Approval role.</p>
<p>By default, there 5 roles on your Pro or Enterprise account.</p>
<ul>
<li>Admin: have full access to the account, include billing.</li>
<li>User: can create, edit, delete all content, screens for the folders they have access to</li>
<li>Content Proposal: can create new files, assets and propose change to playlist</li>
<li>Content Approval: like User, but also have authority to review and approve change proposal</li>
<li>Read Only: can only view what they have access to</li>
</ul>
<p>Pick the Content Proposal role for John.</p>

<p>Once added you will have 2 users like below.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/360102331574" alt="mceclip0.png"></p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="h_01HQ01ER76A40NHXR47Z4PDVY7"><strong>Log in as John the Proposer and make some changes to a playlist</strong></h3>
<p>You will see there's even an A|B view to compare Original vs Proposed.</p>
<p>Once change is made, click on Submit for Approval.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/1500003504041" alt="mceclip5.png"></p>
<p>John can pick to send a notification to All Approvers, or selected approvers, in this case let's select Jane.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> this is only select who are to be notified, all approvers, admins still can review and approve all change proposal.</p>
<p>After proposal submitted, John can still continue to change the playlist till Jane approves it. Once Jane approves, he will need to submit a new proposal.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/1500003504101" alt="mceclip6.png"></p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="h_01HQ01ER76C3K2JRVTGYFGMZDZ"><strong>Proposal Notification and Approval Process:</strong></h3>
<p>If Jane has an email associate with her account, she will get an email notification like below.</p>
<p>She can click on the Review button to be taken straight to the Playlist to review.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/360102332874" alt="mceclip7.png"></p>
<p>Jane will also get notification when she log on to OptiSigns.</p>
<p>Click on the notification item will take her to the playlist in that proposal.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/1500003460722" alt="mceclip8.png"></p>
<p>Jane can review and Reject or Approve the change.</p>
<p>If <strong>Approve</strong> is clicked, the proposed change will be applied to the playlist right away, and if there are screens playing this playlist, the screens will be updated immediately.</p>
<p>Jane can also make more changes, modify to the Proposed Playlist before approving it.</p>
<p>If <strong>Reject</strong> is clicked, proposed change is discarded. Note that you will not be able to recover discarded change once rejected, Jane may want to contact John and suggest changes in that case.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/1500003504701" alt="mceclip9.png"></p>
<p>If Jane went on vacation, came back and there are many approvals waiting for her.</p>
<p>She can go to the Approval Requests page to view them all.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/360102333594" alt="mceclip10.png"></p>
<p>In the Approval Request page, Jane or any Admin, Approvers can see all the pending approval in the system (regardless of who submitted it or who it submitted to).</p>
<p>Jane can review in detail by click View Detail to go to the specific playlist.</p>
<p>Or click approve reject right there.</p>
<p>This page also useful if other Admin, Approvers need to cover for Jane to review change proposal when Janes is not available.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HQ01ER76492W90NCGAY1SWAF"><strong>Summary:</strong></h2>
<p>The idea is for the Content Proposer, contributor to be able to upload files, create new assets, and propose change to playlists.</p>
<p>Content Proposer cannot Edit Screens, Change Assets, Schedule.</p>
<p>We would like to keep the process simple for both the Proposers and Approvers. Imagine if an approver needs to look at a change in an asset that belong to a Playlist that's in a Schedule 2 weeks from now. It would not be easy for the approver to figure out what's the actual impact of the change. </p>
