<p>Sometimes, you need to re-use a playlist inside another playlist. This feature is called a nested playlist or sub-playlist.</p>
<p>For example, there may be a need for a common or global playlist that you want for all of your screens but require there to be some exceptions for regional-specific content to also be shown. Nested Playlists allow you to be able to manage that in an organized manner.</p>
<p>This article assumes you already know how to <a href="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/28295104605843" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create and use Playlists</a> with OptiSigns. <br>If you're not sure, check out that article first.</p>

<p>In this example, we have a Global Playlist that has corporate-level content, and we have Regional playlist where it needs to play the Global Playlist content plus some localized content.</p>
<p>To add an existing Global Playlist into the new Regional playlist, you can navigate to the Playlist tab.</p>
<p>Click "Add Playlist" button</p>

<p>Select the playlist you want to add as nested playlist.<br>In this case it's the Global Playlist.<br>Then click Add.</p>

<p>Now you can see your Global Playlist inside your Regional playlist.<br>You can move the order of the Global Playlist just like any other playlist items.</p>
