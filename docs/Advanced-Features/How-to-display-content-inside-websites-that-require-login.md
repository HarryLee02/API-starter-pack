<p>Sometimes you have content behind a website that requires log-in, such as your project schedule in Atlassian's JIRA, Trello, dashboard behind Tableau, Salesforces, etc.</p>
<p>It can either be a Browser Popup or a Gated Website (like below)</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/360103797493" alt="mceclip0.png"></p>
<p>The solution is simple, you just need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy the link to the page, and dashboard you need to display.</li>
<li>Put it in the Website app in OptiSigns</li>
<li>Then put the asset on your screen or in the playlist as an asset</li>
<li>When it shows up on your device, just use your mouse &amp; keyboard to enter in username and password (remember to save credentials, for Fire TV, you may need a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Illuminated-Living-Room-Keyboard-Touchpad/dp/B00ZOPVSKW/" target="_self">Bluetooth mouse &amp; keyboard</a> to pair and type this information in). </li>
<li>If you don't have a Bluetooth mouse &amp; keyboard, you can use a <a href="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055080914" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">USB HUB adaptor</a> to connect with your mouse &amp; keyboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it, the credential will be saved, and every time OptiSigns plays the link, it will show the secured information inside the website.</p>

<p>You can also prefill a password in your URL for the Browser Popup case such as: <a href="https://guest:guest@jigsaw.w3.org/HTTP/Basic/">https://guest:guest@jigsaw.w3.org/HTTP/Basic/</a></p>
