<p>When you purchase an OptiSigns Android Player, the device will have an MDM software pre-provisioned on the device to provide us the capability to remotely connect to the device for troubleshooting.  You may wonder if that capability can be extended to you as well, so that it is easier on your side to have some control over the device remotely. The answer is yes. With this integration, you will be able to do these things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reboot Device</li>
<li>Take Screenshot</li>
<li>Add/Remove WiFi</li>
<li>Update Time Zone </li>
<li>View Device Info</li>
<li>See Remote Command History</li>
<li>and more</li>
</ul>
