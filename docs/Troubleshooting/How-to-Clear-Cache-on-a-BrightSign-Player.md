<h3 id="h_01HXHNJ19TNMTAVFKNF6RZGBJF">If you're experiencing issues with OptiSigns' applications not performing correctly on your BrightSign player, one of the most common reason is localStorage folder on your SD Card is full.</h3>
<ul>
<li>BrightSigns does not provide API for apps like OptiSigns to clear or delete the local cache folder.</li>
<li>So after sometime, the folder can be so big that it consume all storage on the SD card and cause issues.</li>

<p><strong>1. Insert the SD Card into a Computer:</strong> Use an SD card reader to connect the SD card to your computer.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/29258094750611"></p>
<p><strong>2. Access the SD Card's Contents:</strong> Once the SD card is recognized by your computer, open it in File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac).</p>

<ul>
<li>The exact name can vary based on how the app developer set up the directory structure.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/29258094758035"></p>
<p><strong>4. Check the size of the localStorage Folder</strong></p>

<li>See if the folder is taking up many GBs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Delete the localStorage Folder:</strong> Right-click on the folder and select "<strong>Delete</strong>" to clear all cached data.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re unsure about deleting, you can alternatively move the folder to your computer as a backup before deleting it from the SD card. This may take several minutes depending on how many items are in the folder.</li>
