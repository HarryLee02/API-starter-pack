<p>If you have many screens in different locations, and you want to display local weather, you can just make 1 weather app, and set it to use device's location instead of having to make many weather apps.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>First set your device's location.</p>
<p>In Edit screen, click Advanced, and add location.</p>

<p>You can also edit location of multiple screens at the same time by selecting them and click Edit</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Next, in your weather app select the option to "Use Device Setting's Location".</p>
<p>You still need to set the default location, this location will be used in case device does not have location set up.</p>
