<p>If you are using OptiSigns to display your social feed like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, sometimes you want the option to review/approve certain posts before they show up on your screens. This is particularly useful when you use Hashtags as your social feeds, as this gives you a chance to review the content.</p>
<p>OptiSigns has a built-in content moderation feature that allows you to do just that.</p>
<h4 id="h_01HPZSET4YN8NTNK62KQRMJAVZ"><strong>Here's how to use it:</strong></h4>
<p>If you haven't created your <a href="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016388733" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023848334" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>, or <a href="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016375473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> wall, you can go ahead and create one.</p>
<p>In Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter app settings, click Advance, and there's an option for Moderation.</p>

<p>By default "Always show new posts" is checked, this means that all new posts will automatically show up on your wall/feed.</p>
<p>You can uncheck, and click on the wheel <img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/4403015754515" alt="mceclip1.png" width="49" height="36"> button to moderate the content.</p>
<p>You then can filter, and search for posts.</p>
<p>And click <img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/4403015850387" alt="mceclip3.png"> to hide the post or <img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/4403008606995" alt="mceclip5.png"> to delete the post (delete means the post will be deleted from the list in OptiSigns only, not from your account)</p>
