<p>If you've implemented captions into your video then this guide will briefly show you how to enable those captions on your uploaded Vimeo content. Currently, there is no option to simply turn it on, however, there is another way to do so.</p>
<p>If your videos have <strong>manually added captions</strong>, then your link should look something like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/76979871?autoplay=1&amp;loop=1&amp;texttrack=en">https://player.vimeo.com/video/76979871?autoplay=1&amp;loop=1&amp;texttrack=en</a></p>
<p>For videos that have <strong>auto-generated captions</strong>, then your link should look something like this</p>
<p>(note the "-x-autogen" added at the end):</p>
<p><a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/76979871?autoplay=1&amp;loop=1&amp;texttrack=en-x-autogen" target="_self">https://player.vimeo.com/video/76979871?autoplay=1&amp;loop=1&amp;texttrack=en-x-autogen</a></p>
<p><strong>Please note: If you have a different language caption then you can simply change the abbreviation on the URL from "en" to your preferred language if it is enabled.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>To set this link, you'll need your video's specific ID:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/18498760650643"></p>
<p>This ID can be found on most Vimeo URL links.</p>
<p>Next, you'll simply take this ID and 'plug' it into the URL template here: https://player.vimeo.com/video/<span class="wysiwyg-color-black"><strong>(VIDEO ID HERE)</strong></span>?autoplay=1&amp;loop=1&amp;texttrack=en</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Log into your OptiSigns account and navigate to the <strong>Files/Assets</strong> page and open the apps menu. Search for the <strong>Streaming App</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/18499078738835"></p>
<p>Now you can take the URL link that you've created for your Vimeo video and plug it in.</p>
