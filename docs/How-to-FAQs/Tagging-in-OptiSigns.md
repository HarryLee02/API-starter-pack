<p>Tagging is an essential tool for keeping your content and screens organized. They can be applied to any asset to allow for seamless sorting, and applied to screens to help identify screen location, screen type, hardware, and far more.</p>

<h2 id="h_01JJWHGPGP21ZZ2HZMHRF1891T">Screen Tagging</h2>
<p>Your screens can be tagged in much the same way as an asset. This has a number of different uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organizing numerous screens, by location, type of screen, etc.</li>
<li>Grouping sets of screens together for quick pushes of assets or playlists</li>
<li>Allowing Emergency Messages/CAP Alerts to appear on certain screens with specific tags</li>
<li>Enabling Remote Commands to be able to alter the content displayed on multiple screens at once</li>
</ul>
<p>You can add as many different tags as you want to a screen. Please note that these screen tags are separate from those tags you may have applied to your assets. For more information on tagging assets, see the <a href="#AssetTagging"><strong>Asset Tagging </strong></a>section later in this article.</p>
<p>To tag your screens, select the screens, then hit <strong>Edit</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38062664586387" width="624" height="243"></p>
<p>This will bring up the <strong>Edit Group of Screens </strong>tab. </p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38062664590355" width="417" height="268"></p>
<p>In the “Tags” section, you can click the field and you’ll be able to select from existing tags, or create a new one.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38062653681811" width="476" height="195"></p>
<p><a name="Pushing"></a></p>
<h3 id="h_01JJWHGPGQP6YEY7SWVHGB8VQ1"><span style="color: #434343;">Pushing to Multiple Screens</span></h3>
<p>The most commonly used feature of screen tagging is the ability to push content - be that an asset, playlist, or schedule - to multiple screens at once.</p>
<p>To do this, find the piece of content you wish to push, then click the <strong>Three Dots</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38062664596115" width="175" height="187"></p>
<p>This will open up the Options menu. Click <strong>Push to Screens</strong>. You’ll see the Push to Screens tab:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38062664602003" width="624" height="381"></p>
<p>Here, select the <strong>Target </strong>to say “Tags”:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38062664604691" width="624" height="87"></p>
<p>You can then select the Tags from your previously created Screen Tags.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38062653695891" width="567" height="233"></p>
<p>When done, hit <strong>Push</strong>. Your content will now display on any Online screens that have the tag you selected. This is a method OptiSigns uses to change what displays on numerous screens at once, and can be used to drastically speed up deployments.</p>
<h3 id="h_01JPB3J96EHY7FSN1YY3C41WR3">Tag Rules</h3>
<p>With Tag Rules, it's possible to set a network of Tags for an Asset to display on.</p>
<p>For example, let's say you want an advertisement to play only in customer-facing screens, but only in certain locations. You can combine these screens into a single Tag Rule, then push content to only those screens.</p>
<p>To do this, select the <strong>Target </strong>to say <strong>Tag Rules </strong>on the Push to Screens tab:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39406606002195" alt="firefox_Cnp46Hnyhc.jpg"></p>
<p>Hit <strong>New:</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39406610743827" alt="firefox_GcChrnf831.jpg"></strong></p>
<p>This will bring up the Screen Tag Rule screen:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39406606004371" alt="rpA5cqMfxw.jpg"></p>
<p>Here, you have the ability to <strong>Include </strong>or <strong>Exclude </strong>certain tags using and/or logic commands. You can add <strong>Rules </strong>or <strong>Rulesets </strong>to make these as elaborate as you like:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39406606006547" alt="firefox_XiHCAOKT8K.jpg"></p>
<p>When you're ready to go, simply click on any Field and you'll be prompted to Add a tag via a dropdown menu:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39406606007699" alt="firefox_VwCzrxr0yH.jpg"></p>
<p>Now you're ready to include or exclude any tags you'd like. When you're finished, hit <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p>You'll then be able to select this Tag Rule on the Push to Screens tab, and use it across your assets.</p>
<p><a name="RemoteCommands"></a></p>
<h3 id="h_01JJWHGPGQ4VDG9VCQ93ACX53H"><span style="color: #434343;">Tagging for Remote Commands</span></h3>
<p>Screen tags can also be used by OptiSigns Remote Commands to send direct commands to multiple screens at a time. This can be anything from forcing an update to changing the content displaying on screen.</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="wysiwyg-text-align-center" style="width: 100%;"><strong>NOTE</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 100%;">Remote Commands can only be used by <strong>Pro Plus </strong>subscribers or above.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<p>For more information on how to send Remote Commands via tag, see our article on <a href="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408658251027-How-to-use-Remote-Command-Execution-Windows-Linux"><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline" style="color: #1155cc;">Remote Command Execution</span></strong></a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="AssetTagging"></a></p>
<h2 id="h_01JJWHGPGPG5725T5EKPYMD9T0">Asset Tagging</h2>
<p>Tagging assets can be extremely helpful when you have many screens across many locations and when certain content does not apply to all screens.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you want to advertise certain special deals in one location, but not another. This asset can be tagged with a simple “location” marker, which will signal where it should be displayed. You can apply as many tags as you like to a single asset.</p>
<p>Tags may only be applied to existing assets in OptiSigns. To learn how to create an asset, see our article on <a href="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016247974-How-to-Upload-Manage-Your-Files-Assets"><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline" style="color: #1155cc;">How to Upload and Manage Files and Assets</span></strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Once there is an asset to tag, from within the <strong>Files/Assets </strong>tab on the OptiSigns portal, there are two methods to add/edit tags:</p>
<ol>
<li>Single asset</li>
<li>Multiple (bulk) assets</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="SingleAsset"></a></p>
<h3 id="h_01JJWHGPGPBDXD6GQZ4VE0GPA4"><span style="color: #434343;">Single Asset Tagging</span></h3>
<p>Single asset tagging is quite simple: just click the <strong>Three Dots </strong>on the asset you wish to tag, then choose <strong>Edit Tags</strong> from the drop down menu:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38062664617235" width="168" height="372"></p>
<p>This will open up the Edit Tags menu for this single asset:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38062653705235" width="489" height="253"></p>
<p>Clicking within the Tags field will bring up a list of existing tags that you can select from. You can also input a new tag here to create it.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38062664624019" width="494" height="94"></p>
<p>This feature is most useful for adding individual tags to specific assets that may be different from those around it.</p>
<p><a name="MultiAsset"></a></p>
<h3 id="h_01JJWHGPGP3QGQDKQ1YA6HTQVF"><span style="color: #434343;">Multi Asset Tagging</span></h3>
<p>The most useful way to apply tags to large numbers of assets at once is by multi tagging. This is similar to applying tags to a single asset, except it can be used to apply the tag(s) to numerous assets at once.</p>
<p>In order to do this, you’ll need to click the Circle icon in the upper left corner of the assets you want to tag.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38062664627603" width="365" height="189"></p>
<p>Once you’ve selected the assets you wish to apply the tag(s) to, click the “Edit Tags” button:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38062664630035" width="624" height="408"></p>
<p>This will open up the Edit Tags menu for this single asset:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38062653705235" width="489" height="253"></p>
<p>Clicking within the Tags field will bring up a list of existing tags that you can select from. You can also input a new tag here to create it.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38062664624019" width="494" height="94"></p>

<p><a name="UseExamples"></a></p>
<h2 id="h_01JJWHGPGQAKR37AFE9932SBPC">Tagging Use Examples</h2>
<p>OptiSigns tagging capabilities make it one of our most powerful features, with numerous capabilities being unlocked through it. Here, we’ll lay out some common use case examples. Bear in mind that there are numerous other ways to use tags to enhance your experience, and that these are but a few.</p>
<p><a name="Organization"></a></p>
<h3 id="h_01JJWHGPGQX8PRDK3NBG4N10MS"><span style="color: #434343;">Asset Tagging for Organization</span></h3>
<p>Applying multiple tags to your assets will allow you to find them easier for when you need them. These tags can be anything from what type of material they are, to what the substance of the content is, to where they need to be displayed and far more.</p>
<p>Any time a tag is created, it is added to the list on the left of your screen in the <strong>Files/Asset </strong>tab:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38062653720851" width="340" height="376"></p>
<p>Any of these tags are clickable. Doing so will highlight them green.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38062653723283" width="304" height="327"></p>
<p>Now, this is useful on its own, as it will then only display assets which possess that tag:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38062653726227" width="310" height="190"></p>
<p>Selecting multiple tags will display any assets that have any of these tags:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38062664645651" width="255" height="272"><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38062653733139" width="378" height="154"></p>
<p>This can also be used inside any folder to the same effect:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38062653739539" width="399" height="307"></p>
<p>These tags, essentially, provide a filter for what content will be displayed. Combining these tags with your folders makes it extremely easy to locate assets relevant to what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>Tags can also be used to denote Expired assets (i.e. a Christmas message from last year), which makes them easy to filter out.</p>
<p>Currently, OptiSigns allows creation of up to 40 asset tags.</p>
<p><a name="SimultaneousUpdating"></a></p>
<h3 id="h_01JJWHGPGQ9JEJRRQ39655DBYH"><span style="color: #434343;">Screen Tagging for Simultaneous Updating</span></h3>
<p>In this example, when creating a screen, we’ll add at least a couple of tags to it denoting the device’s primary location, device type, or device purpose:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/38062653743507" width="624" height="80"></p>
<p>These “location” tags allow screens in a specific spot to receive commands quickly. The “device” type lets your IT team and our support team quickly identify the type of screen or device you’re running OptiSigns on in case of a problem. A “purpose” tag lets you identify which screens are being used for what purpose (ex. “Marketing” or “Internal”).</p>
<p>As we’ve mentioned before, setting these tags allows you to quickly push Assets, Playlists, or Schedules to screens, but there’s more to it. It also lets you batch update your hardware with the latest version of OptiSigns</p>
<p>Don’t forget: it’s possible to add as many tags as you’d like to any given screen or asset, so don’t hesitate to create complex webs or simple notation as you like. Feel free to experiment with the feature to make the easiest experience for your business.</p>
